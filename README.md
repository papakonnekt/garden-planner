Garden Manager App
Project Title and Description
The Garden Manager App is a standalone, visually stunning, and highly interactive 3D tool designed to help users plan, track, and optimize their garden beds. It leverages detailed inputs to provide intelligent companion planting recommendations and environmental insights. Focusing on local garden data and plant compatibility, the app offers a fully 3D representation of the user's garden space, prioritizing an immersive experience with smooth animations and intuitive controls.

Key Features
Garden Bed Manager: Define bed name, dimensions, type (in-ground, raised, container), trellis setup, sunlight exposure, soil pH, soil type, drainage, moisture retention, irrigation method, and notes. Features a fully 3D visual interface for drag-and-drop plant placement with real-time feedback.
Plant Library: An extensive plant database located at https://github.com/papakonnekt/garden_database, allowing search by various criteria. Each plant profile includes detailed information on preferred conditions, compatibility (companion and incompatible plants), pests/diseases, light needs, size, seasonality, edibility, and high-quality 3D models representing different growth stages.
Advanced Companion Planting Engine: Utilizes environmental data inputs (soil pH, sunlight, drainage, moisture, root system, soil texture) and compatibility factors (pH matching, root synergy, nutrient complementarity, pest/disease suppression, etc.) to provide visual indicators and dynamic recommendations directly on the 3D plant models. Includes tooltips and LLM-powered natural language Q&A.
Dashboard and Bed Overview: Provides an overview of all garden beds, quick stats (water needs, sunlight hours, compatible pairs, pest-prone combos), a daily/weekly task list auto-generated from plant growth stages, and a visual map view of the entire garden layout.
Next-Generation Visuals & Interaction: A core focus on achieving a visually stunning, highly interactive, and fully 3D experience. Key elements include a realistic 3D environment, high-fidelity assets, dynamic lighting and weather simulation, fluid camera controls, interactive visualizations (environmental overlays, planting simulation, compatibility feedback, task highlighting), and smooth animations.

  /lib               # Third-party integrations (e.g., Three.js)
Data Flow
User inputs are managed via Zustand state and persisted locally. State changes drive updates in the UI and recalculations in the 3D scene using React Three Fiber. The companion planting engine runs calculations in Web Workers for performance, and visual feedback is rendered in the 3D scene using shaders and particle systems.

Implementation Roadmap
The project implementation is planned in the following phases:

Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (2-3 weeks)
Phase 2: Plant Library & Companion Engine (3-4 weeks)
Phase 3: Visual Enhancement (2-3 weeks)
Phase 4: Interactivity & Polish (2-3 weeks)
Phase 5: Optimization & Testing (1-2 weeks)
Phase 6: Optional Features
