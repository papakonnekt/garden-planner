# Checklist: Advanced Lighting & Shadows

**Phase:** 3D System & Integration
**Plan Item:** 22

---

**Objective:** Implement dynamic and realistic lighting and shadow effects in the Three.js scene, including directional sunlight/moonlight, ambient light, and ambient occlusion.

**References:**
- Design Document: "3D Environment Design", "Lighting"

---

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Refine the directional light setup to accurately simulate sunlight and moonlight based on time of day.
- [ ] Implement soft ambient lighting to fill in shadows and provide overall scene illumination.
- [ ] Add ambient occlusion to enhance depth and realism by simulating contact shadows.
- [ ] Configure shadow mapping for the directional light to cast realistic shadows from objects in the scene.
- [ ] Adjust shadow parameters (e.g., shadow map size, bias) to optimize quality and performance.
- [ ] Implement logic to update lighting and shadows dynamically based on the day-night cycle or user input.
- [ ] Test the appearance of lighting and shadows at different times of day.
- [ ] Ensure shadows are cast correctly by all relevant objects (beds, plants, environmental elements).
