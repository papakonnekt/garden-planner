# Checklist: Particle Effects & Visual Flourishes

**Phase:** 3D System & Integration
**Plan Item:** 23

---

**Objective:** Implement particle systems in the Three.js scene for visual effects such as pollen, dust (digging), and rain splashes to enhance realism and interactivity.

**References:**
- Design Document: "Visual Enhancements", "Particle Effects"

---

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Set up a particle system in Three.js for pollen effects, potentially emitted from flowering plants.
- [ ] Implement a particle system for dust effects that triggers when digging or placing beds/plants.
- [ ] Create a particle system for rain splashes that appears on surfaces during rain weather effects.
- [ ] Configure particle properties (e.g., size, color, lifetime, emission rate) for each effect.
- [ ] Implement logic to control the emission and behavior of particle systems based on in-app events (e.g., placing a plant, weather changes).
- [ ] Optimize particle system performance to avoid frame rate drops.
- [ ] Test the visual appearance and performance of each particle effect.
