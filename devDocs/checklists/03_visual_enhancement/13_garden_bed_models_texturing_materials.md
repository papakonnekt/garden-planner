# Checklist: Garden Bed Models - Texturing & Materials

**Phase:** 3D Asset Creation (Blender)
**Plan Item:** 13

---

**Objective:** Create and apply realistic textures and PBR materials to the garden bed models in Blender, ensuring they are optimized for real-time rendering.

**References:**
- Design Document: "Technology Stack", "3D Asset Pipeline", "Visual Design and User Experience", "Materials" under "3D Environment Design", "3D Garden Bed Manager"

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Gather or create texture maps (Albedo, Normal, Roughness, Metallic) for the different garden bed materials (wood, metal, soil edges, etc.).
- [ ] In Blender, set up PBR materials using the Principled BSDF shader for each material type.
- [ ] Apply the created texture maps to the corresponding material nodes for the garden bed models.
- [ ] Adjust material properties to achieve a realistic look for wood grain, metal surfaces, etc.
- [ ] Ensure textures are appropriately UV-unwrapped on the models.
- [ ] Optimize texture resolutions and formats for performance.
- [ ] Test how the materials look under different lighting conditions in Blender.
- [ ] Save the Blender file(s) with the applied textures and materials.
