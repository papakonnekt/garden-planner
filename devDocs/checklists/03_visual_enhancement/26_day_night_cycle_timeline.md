# Checklist: Day-Night Cycle & Timeline

**Phase:** 3D System & Integration
**Plan Item:** 26

---

**Objective:** Implement a real-time day-night cycle in the Three.js scene with dynamic lighting and shadows, and create a scrubable timeline UI element to control the time of day.

**References:**
- Design Document: "3D Environment Design", "Day-Night Cycle", "Dashboard and Navigation"

---

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Implement logic to track and update the current time of day in the application state.
- [ ] Connect the time of day state to the directional light's position and intensity to simulate sun/moon movement.
- [ ] Ensure shadows update dynamically as the light source moves.
- [ ] Create a UI component for a scrubable timeline that represents a 24-hour cycle.
- [ ] Link the timeline UI to the application state to allow users to change the time of day by scrubbing.
- [ ] Implement smooth transitions for lighting and shadow changes when the timeline is adjusted.
- [ ] (Optional) Implement subtle environmental changes based on time of day (e.g., fog, star visibility).
- [ ] Test the day-night cycle and timeline functionality to ensure smooth transitions and accurate lighting.
