# Checklist: Wildlife Models - Modeling & Texturing

**Phase:** 3D Asset Creation (Blender)
**Plan Item:** 16

---

**Objective:** Create and texture simple 3D models for wildlife elements like butterflies and birds in Blender, optimized for use with particle systems or simple animations.

**References:**
- Design Document: "Technology Stack", "3D Asset Pipeline", "Ecosystem", "Dynamic Ecosystem" under "Visual Enhancements"

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Identify the types of wildlife models needed (e.g., a few variations of butterflies and birds).
- [ ] Gather reference images for the selected wildlife.
- [ ] In Blender, create a new file or collection for wildlife models.
- [ ] Model simple, low-polygon geometry for each wildlife type, focusing on recognizable shapes.
- [ ] Create or gather texture maps for the materials, potentially using simple color palettes or stylized textures.
- [ ] Set up basic materials and apply textures to the models.
- [ ] Ensure textures are appropriately UV-unwrapped.
- [ ] Optimize models and textures for performance, as they will likely be used in particle systems or instanced.
- [ ] Name the models according to the established naming convention.
- [ ] Save the Blender file(s) for the wildlife models.
