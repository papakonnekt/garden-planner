# Checklist: Plant Models - Texturing & Materials

**Phase:** 3D Asset Creation (Blender)
**Plan Item:** 10

---

**Objective:** Create and apply realistic textures and PBR materials to the plant models in Blender, ensuring they are optimized for real-time rendering.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Gather or create texture maps (Albedo, Normal, Roughness, Metallic, Alpha) for each plant model and its different growth stages.
- [ ] In Blender, set up a PBR material workflow using the Principled BSDF shader.
- [ ] Apply the created texture maps to the corresponding material nodes for each plant model.
- [ ] Adjust material properties (e.g., roughness, subsurface scattering for leaves) to achieve a realistic look.
- [ ] Ensure textures are appropriately UV-unwrapped on the models.
- [ ] Optimize texture resolutions and formats for performance in a web environment.
- [ ] Test how the materials look under different lighting conditions in Blender.
- [ ] Save the Blender file(s) with the applied textures and materials.
