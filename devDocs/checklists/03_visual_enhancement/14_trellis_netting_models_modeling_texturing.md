# Checklist: Trellis/Netting Models - Modeling & Texturing

**Phase:** 3D Asset Creation (Blender)
**Plan Item:** 14

---

**Objective:** Create and texture 3D models for trellis and netting setups in Blender, following the established workflow and naming conventions.

**References:**
- PRD: "Garden Bed Manager"
- Design Document: "Technology Stack", "3D Asset Pipeline", "3D Garden Bed Manager"

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Identify the types of trellis and netting setups to be modeled (e.g., vertical, horizontal).
- [ ] Gather reference images or design specifications for each type.
- [ ] In Blender, create a new file or collection for trellis and netting models.
- [ ] Model the basic geometry for each trellis and netting type, considering modularity if needed.
- [ ] Create or gather texture maps for the materials (e.g., wood, metal, netting).
- [ ] Set up PBR materials and apply textures to the models.
- [ ] Ensure textures are appropriately UV-unwrapped.
- [ ] Optimize models and textures for performance.
- [ ] Name the models according to the established naming convention.
- [ ] Save the Blender file(s) for the trellis and netting models.
