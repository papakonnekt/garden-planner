# Checklist: Plant Models - Modeling (Seedling Stage)

**Phase:** 3D Asset Creation (Blender)
**Plan Item:** 7

---

**Objective:** Create detailed 3D models for the seedling stage of various plants in Blender, following the established workflow and naming conventions.

**References:**
- PRD: "Plant Library"
- Design Document: "Technology Stack", "3D Asset Pipeline", "Plant Library and Visualization"

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Identify the initial set of plants for which seedling models are needed.
- [ ] Gather reference images or botanical illustrations for the seedling stage of each selected plant.
- [ ] In Blender, create a new file or collection for seedling models.
- [ ] Model the basic geometry for the seedling stage of each plant, focusing on key characteristics like initial leaves and stem.
- [ ] Ensure models are appropriately scaled relative to real-world plant sizes.
- [ ] Apply basic materials or color to distinguish different plant models during the modeling phase.
- [ ] Name the models according to the established naming convention.
- [ ] Save the Blender file(s) for the seedling models.
