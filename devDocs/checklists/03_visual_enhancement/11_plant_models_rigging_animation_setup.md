# Checklist: Plant Models - Rigging & Animation Setup

**Phase:** 3D Asset Creation (Blender)
**Plan Item:** 11

---

**Objective:** Set up basic rigging or shape keys in Blender for plant models to enable wind and growth animations in the frontend.

---

**Tasks:**

- [ ] For plants requiring wind animation, set up a simple bone structure (rig) or use shape keys to control swaying motion.
- [ ] For plants requiring growth stage transitions, set up shape keys or a bone structure that allows for smooth morphing between seedling, mid-growth, and mature stages.
- [ ] Ensure the rigging or shape keys are compatible with glTF export and the Three.js AnimationMixer.
- [ ] Test the animations within Blender to ensure they look natural.
- [ ] Name the animations and related components according to the established naming convention.
- [ ] Save the Blender file(s) with the rigging and animation setups.
