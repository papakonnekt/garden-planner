# Checklist: Plant Models - Modeling (Mid-Growth Stage)

**Phase:** 3D Asset Creation (Blender)
**Plan Item:** 8

---

**Objective:** Create detailed 3D models for the mid-growth stage of various plants in Blender, following the established workflow and naming conventions.

**References:**
- PRD: "Plant Library"
- Design Document: "Technology Stack", "3D Asset Pipeline", "Plant Library and Visualization"

---

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Identify the plants for which mid-growth stage models are needed.
- [ ] Gather reference images or botanical illustrations for the mid-growth stage of each selected plant.
- [ ] In Blender, create a new file or collection for mid-growth models, or work within existing plant files.
- [ ] Model the geometry for the mid-growth stage of each plant, showing increased size, foliage, and branching compared to the seedling stage.
- [ ] Ensure models are appropriately scaled relative to real-world plant sizes and the seedling models.
- [ ] Apply basic materials or color to distinguish different plant models during the modeling phase.
- [ ] Name the models according to the established naming convention.
- [ ] Save the Blender file(s) for the mid-growth models.
