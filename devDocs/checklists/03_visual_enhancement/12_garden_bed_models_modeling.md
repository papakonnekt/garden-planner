# Checklist: Garden Bed Models - Modeling

**Phase:** 3D Asset Creation (Blender)
**Plan Item:** 12

---

**Objective:** Create detailed 3D models for different types of garden beds in Blender, following the established workflow and naming conventions.

**References:**
- PRD: "Garden Bed Manager"
- Design Document: "Technology Stack", "3D Asset Pipeline", "3D Garden Bed Manager"

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Identify the different garden bed types to be modeled (in-ground, raised, container).
- [ ] Gather reference images or design specifications for each bed type.
- [ ] In Blender, create a new file or collection for garden bed models.
- [ ] Model the basic geometry for each garden bed type, ensuring accurate dimensions and proportions based on potential user inputs.
- [ ] Design the models to be modular if required for the parametric implementation in the frontend.
- [ ] Ensure models are appropriately scaled relative to real-world sizes and the plant models.
- [ ] Apply basic materials or color to distinguish different bed types during the modeling phase.
- [ ] Name the models according to the established naming convention.
- [ ] Save the Blender file(s) for the garden bed models.
