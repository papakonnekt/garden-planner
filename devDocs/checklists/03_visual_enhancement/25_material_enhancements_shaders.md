# Checklist: Material Enhancements & Shaders

**Phase:** 3D System & Integration
**Plan Item:** 25

---

**Objective:** Enhance the visual quality of materials in the Three.js scene by implementing PBR materials and developing custom shaders for effects like dynamic soil appearance and wet surfaces.

**References:**
- Design Document: "3D Environment Design", "Materials", "3D Garden Bed Manager"

---

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Ensure all 3D models are using PBR materials correctly configured in Three.js.
- [ ] Implement a custom shader for soil that dynamically changes appearance (e.g., darkens) based on moisture levels from the application state.
- [ ] Develop a custom shader or material effect for wet surfaces that activates during rain weather effects.
- [ ] Apply bump maps and other texture maps (Normal, Roughness, Metallic) to materials to enhance detail and realism.
- [ ] Optimize material and shader performance to minimize rendering overhead.
- [ ] Test the appearance of materials and custom shaders under different lighting and environmental conditions.
