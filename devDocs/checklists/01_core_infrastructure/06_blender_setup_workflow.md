# Checklist: Blender Setup & Workflow

**Phase:** 3D Asset Creation (Blender)
**Plan Item:** 6

---

**Objective:** Establish the Blender environment and define the asset pipeline for creating and exporting 3D models in glTF format, as required for integration with the chosen frontend technology.

**References:**
- Design Document: "Technology Stack", "3D Asset Pipeline" under "Next-Generation Visuals & Interaction"

---

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Ensure Blender is installed and configured.
- [ ] Set up a project directory structure within Blender for organizing assets (e.g., separate files or collections for plants, beds, environment).
- [ ] Configure Blender's export settings for the glTF 2.0 format to ensure compatibility with Three.js/React Three Fiber.
- [ ] Establish a naming convention for 3D models and materials to maintain consistency.
- [ ] Define a workflow for importing reference images or concept art into Blender for modeling.
- [ ] Set up basic lighting and camera in Blender for previewing assets during creation.
- [ ] Plan the process for handling different levels of detail (LOD) for assets if required for performance.
- [ ] Outline the process for version control of Blender files (if applicable).
- [ ] Create a test export of a simple cube or placeholder object to verify the glTF export pipeline works correctly.
