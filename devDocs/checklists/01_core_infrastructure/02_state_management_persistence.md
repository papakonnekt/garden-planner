# Checklist: State Management & Persistence

**Phase:** Core Infrastructure & Setup
**Plan Item:** 2

---

**Objective:** Configure Zustand for application state management and implement local storage persistence as specified in the Design Document.

**References:**
- Design Document: "Technology Stack", "Core Architecture", "Data Flow"

---

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Install Zustand dependency.
- [ ] Install a library for local storage persistence with Zustand (e.g., `zustand/middleware`).
- [ ] Define the initial state structure for the application (e.g., garden beds, plants, settings).
- [ ] Create the Zustand store(s) with appropriate actions and selectors.
- [ ] Implement local storage persistence for the relevant parts of the state.
- [ ] Test state updates and persistence across application reloads.
- [ ] Ensure state changes correctly trigger UI updates.
