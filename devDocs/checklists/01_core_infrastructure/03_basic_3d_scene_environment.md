**Phase:** Core Infrastructure & Setup
**Plan Item:** 3

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Create a main 3D scene component using React Three Fiber (e.g., `src/components/3d/Scene.jsx`).
- [ ] Set up the R3F Canvas with basic camera controls (e.g., `OrbitControls`).
- [ ] Implement a basic ground plane or terrain using Three.js geometry and materials.
- [ ] Add a simple skybox or background color to the scene.
- [ ] Set up initial dynamic lighting, such as a basic directional light to simulate sunlight.
- [ ] Position the camera and lights appropriately for an initial view of the garden area.
- [ ] Verify that the basic 3D scene renders correctly in the browser.
