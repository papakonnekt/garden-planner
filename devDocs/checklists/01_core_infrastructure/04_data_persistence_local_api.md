- Design Document: "Technology Stack", "Core Architecture", "Data Flow", "Data Storage"

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Identify or create utility functions for making API calls to `http://localhost:8000`.
- [ ] Implement basic GET requests to fetch initial garden data and plant information from the local server.
- [ ] Implement basic POST/PUT requests to save garden bed and plant placement data to the local server.
- [ ] Integrate API calls with the Zustand store to load and save application state.
- [ ] Handle potential API errors or connection issues gracefully.
- [ ] Ensure data loaded from the API correctly populates the application state.
- [ ] Verify that changes made in the application are successfully saved to the local database via the API.
