# Checklist: Interactivity - Haptic Feedback & Micro-interactions

**Phase:** Feature Implementation & Polish
**Plan Item:** 38

---

**Objective:** Implement haptic feedback on supported devices and add subtle micro-interactions and animations to UI elements and 3D objects using GSAP.

**References:**
- Design Document: "Interactivity Enhancements", "Haptic Feedback", "Animation Details", "Micro-Interactions"

---

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Implement haptic feedback for key user interactions on supported devices (e.g., plant placement, task completion).
- [ ] Identify UI elements and 3D objects that would benefit from micro-interactions (e.g., buttons, icons, selected plants).
- [ ] Use GSAP to implement subtle animations for UI elements on hover, click, or state change (e.g., scaling, fading, slight movement).
- [ ] Use GSAP or Three.js animations for micro-interactions on 3D objects (e.g., a subtle pulse on selection, a small bounce on placement).
- [ ] Ensure animations are smooth and do not feel jarring or distracting.
- [ ] Optimize animations for performance across different devices.
- [ ] Test haptic feedback on supported devices.
- [ ] Test all implemented micro-interactions and animations.
