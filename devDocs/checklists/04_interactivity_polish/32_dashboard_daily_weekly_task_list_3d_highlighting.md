# Checklist: Dashboard - Daily/Weekly Task List & 3D Highlighting

**Phase:** Feature Implementation & Polish
**Plan Item:** 32

---

**Objective:** Implement the daily/weekly task list feature on the dashboard, auto-generated from plant growth stages, and visually highlight affected plants in the 3D view.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Implement logic to generate daily or weekly tasks based on the growth stage and needs of plants in the garden (e.g., watering, fertilizing, harvesting).
- [ ] Create a UI component to display the auto-generated task list on the dashboard.
- [ ] Implement logic to determine which plants are associated with each task.
- [ ] In the 3D scene, implement a visual highlighting effect for plants that require attention based on the task list (e.g., a glow, outline, or icon).
- [ ] Connect the task list UI to the 3D highlighting, so selecting a task highlights the relevant plants in the scene.
- [ ] Ensure the task list and 3D highlighting update dynamically as plant states or time of day changes.
- [ ] Test the task generation, display, and 3D highlighting functionality.
