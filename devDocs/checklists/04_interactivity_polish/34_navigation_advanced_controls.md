# Checklist: Navigation - Advanced Controls (Multi-touch, Snap-to-views, Walkthrough)

**Phase:** Feature Implementation & Polish
**Plan Item:** 34

---

**Objective:** Implement advanced camera navigation controls, including multi-touch gestures, snap-to-views, and a first-person walkthrough mode.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Implement multi-touch gestures for camera control (e.g., three-finger swipe for pan, pinch for zoom, two-finger rotation for orbit).
- [ ] Create predefined camera views (e.g., top-down, isometric, view of a specific bed).
- [ ] Implement a "snap-to-view" functionality that smoothly transitions the camera to a predefined view.
- [ ] Implement a first-person "walkthrough" mode for immersive exploration of the garden.
- [ ] Design controls for the walkthrough mode (e.g., keyboard input, virtual joystick).
- [ ] Implement collision detection in walkthrough mode to prevent passing through objects.
- [ ] (Optional) Implement cinematic flythroughs with timed transitions using GSAP.
- [ ] Ensure smooth transitions between different navigation modes (orbital, walkthrough, snap-to-view).
- [ ] Test all advanced navigation controls and transitions.
