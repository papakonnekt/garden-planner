**Objective:** Integrate the AI gardening robot model into the 3D scene and implement the smart suggestions feature with speech bubbles.

**References:**
- Design Document: "Interactivity Enhancements", "Smart Suggestions", "AI-driven assistant (3D gardening robot)"

---

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Load and integrate the exported AI gardening robot 3D model into the Three.js scene.
- [ ] Position the robot in the scene, potentially with a fixed location or simple navigation.
- [ ] Implement logic to trigger smart suggestions based on user actions or garden state (e.g., placing incompatible plants, low moisture levels).
- [ ] Create a UI component for displaying speech bubbles near the AI robot.
- [ ] Implement logic to populate speech bubbles with relevant tips and suggestions.
- [ ] Use GSAP for animating the fade-in and fade-out of speech bubbles.
- [ ] Connect the smart suggestion logic to the speech bubble UI.
- [ ] (Optional) Implement simple animations for the robot (e.g., idle movement, gesturing).
- [ ] Test the triggering and display of smart suggestions and speech bubbles.
