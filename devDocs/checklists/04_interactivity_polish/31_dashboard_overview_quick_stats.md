**References:**
- PRD: "Dashboard and Bed Overview"
- Design Document: "Core Architecture", "UI", "Dashboard and Navigation", "Details" under "Dashboard and Navigation"

---

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Create a React component for the dashboard overview section (e.g., `src/components/garden/DashboardOverview.jsx`).
- [ ] Implement logic to calculate quick stats from the application state (e.g., total water needs, total sunlight hours, number of compatible pairs, pest-prone combos).
- [ ] Display the calculated quick stats in the dashboard UI.
- [ ] Design the visual presentation of the quick stats, potentially using animated panels as suggested in the design.
- [ ] Ensure the stats update dynamically as the garden data changes.
- [ ] (Optional) Implement a miniature 3D representation of the entire garden space for the overview.
- [ ] Test the calculation and display of all quick stats.
