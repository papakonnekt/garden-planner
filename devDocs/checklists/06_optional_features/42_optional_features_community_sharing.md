**Tasks:**

- [ ] Implement functionality to export the current garden layout data (including bed configurations, plant placements, and relevant properties) to a JSON file.
- [ ] Implement functionality to export the 3D representation of the garden layout to a standard 3D format like glTF.
- [ ] Create UI elements for triggering the export functionality (e.g., "Export as JSON", "Export as glTF" buttons).
- [ ] Implement functionality to import garden layout data from a JSON file.
- [ ] Implement functionality to import garden layout data from a glTF file, parsing the 3D information and recreating the garden scene.
- [ ] Handle potential errors during file export and import (e.g., invalid file format, corrupted data).
- [ ] Ensure imported data correctly populates the application state and updates the 3D scene.
- [ ] Test exporting and importing garden layouts in both JSON and glTF formats.
