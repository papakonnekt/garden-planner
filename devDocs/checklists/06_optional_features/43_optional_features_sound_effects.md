# Checklist: Optional Features - Sound Effects

**Phase:** Feature Implementation & Polish
**Plan Item:** 43

---

**Objective:** (Optional) Implement sound effects for the application, such as environmental sounds and micro-interaction feedback, using the Web Audio API or pre-recorded files.

**References:**
- Design Document: "Optional Features", "Sound Effects"

---

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Identify the key in-app events or environmental elements that should have associated sound effects (e.g., rustling leaves, bird chirps, button clicks, plant placement).
- [ ] Gather or create sound assets (audio files) for the desired effects.
- [ ] Implement audio playback using the Web Audio API or HTML5 Audio elements.
- [ ] Implement logic to trigger the appropriate sound effects based on in-app events or the state of 3D objects.
- [ ] Implement spatial audio for relevant sounds (e.g., bird chirps coming from a specific area) based on the camera's position.
- [ ] Create a UI option to toggle sound effects on or off.
- [ ] Ensure sound levels are balanced and not intrusive.
- [ ] Test all implemented sound effects and spatial audio.
