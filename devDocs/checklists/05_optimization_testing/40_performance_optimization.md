# Checklist: Performance Optimization

**Phase:** Feature Implementation & Polish
**Plan Item:** 40

---

**Objective:** Optimize the application's performance to achieve the target frame rates on both desktop and mobile devices.

**References:**
- Design Document: "Performance Targets", "Optimizations"

---

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Implement frustum culling to avoid rendering objects outside the camera's view.
- [ ] Utilize instanced rendering for duplicate objects like plants or environmental elements.
- [ ] Implement texture atlasing to combine multiple textures into a single larger one.
- [ ] Implement Levels of Detail (LOD) for complex 3D models to render simpler versions at a distance.
- [ ] Implement progressive asset loading to load assets gradually as needed.
- [ ] Ensure Web Workers are effectively offloading heavy calculations (e.g., companion planting).
- [ ] Profile the application's performance to identify bottlenecks.
- [ ] Optimize shaders and materials for rendering efficiency.
- [ ] Minimize the number of draw calls in the Three.js scene.
- [ ] Test performance on various target devices and screen resolutions.
- [ ] Aim to achieve 60 FPS on desktop and 30 FPS on mobile.
